I wrote this clock app because Windows 11 does not behave like Windows 10 when you click the clock, a calendar
would open showing the time in a font big enough for me to read.

The app is set with Top Most being true, which means the app is front of other apps on the desktop.

Program took all of 15 minutes to write.
